# java-basic-calculator
A basic calculator which can currently perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo division.

I started this project to create a basic calculator which can perform multiple operations on different values and to also learn how to UI works in Java. However, plans for UI in this project will come much later when the main features are finished.
## Future goals
#### Short-term goals:
- Add the ability to give a^b (e.g. 2^4 = 16).
- Add the ability for users to give longer equations inlcuding the use of brackets.
- Add error handling when a user enters a string whilst entering a number
#### Long-term goals:
- Add JUnit testing
- Use JavaFX or Swing to make the calculator into an application.
