A basic calculator which can currently perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo division.

I started this project to create a basic calculator which can perform multiple operations on different values and learn how UI works in Java. 

## Future goals
#### Short-term goals:
- Add the ability to give a^b (e.g. 2^4 = 16).
- Add the ability for users to give longer equations inlcuding the use of brackets.
- Add error handling when a user enters a string whilst entering a number
#### Long-term goals:
- Add JUnit testing
- Use JavaFX or Swing to make the calculator into an application.
